Agile software development is an umbrella term for a set of frameworks and practices based on the values and principles expressed in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development and the 12 Principles behind it. When you approach software development in a particular manner, it’s generally good to live by these values and principles and use them to help figure out the right things to do given your particular context.

Ultimately, Agile is a mindset informed by the Agile Manifesto’s values and principles. ==Methodology is the set of conventions that a team agrees to follow==. Each team will have its own methodology in a way that follows Agile values and principles.

Scrum and XP (Xtreme programming) were born from a single team’s methodology, but they became frameworks when they were generalized to be used by other teams. The Agile Manifesto and the 12 Principles were written by a group of software developers (and a tester) to address issues that software developers faced. It describes how you perform some activity.
