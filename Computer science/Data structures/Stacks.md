First-in last-out data structure
**Stack** is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be **LIFO(Last In First Out)** or **FILO(First In Last Out)**. LIFO implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first and **FILO** implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.
