In software engineering, version control is a class of systems responsible for managing changes to computer programs, documents, large web sites, or other collections of information. Version control is a component of software configuration management.
## Common terminology
**Baseline**: An approved revision of a document or source file to which subsequent changes can be made.

**Blame**: A search for the author and revision that last modified a particular line.

**Branch**: A set of files under version control may be _branched_ or _forked_ at a point in time so that, from that time forward, two copies of those files may develop at different speeds or in different ways independently of each other.

**Change**: represents a specific modification to a document under version control. The granularity of the modification considered a change varies between version control systems.
