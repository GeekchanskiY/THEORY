Programming language - system of notations to write computer programs.
Basically the idea is to make code more human-readable than computer instructions written on assembly or something like that. This is being achieved using [[translators]]. 

According to translation technologies, there are two basic types of programming languages:

[[compiled_programming_languages]]
[[interpreted_programming_languages]]
