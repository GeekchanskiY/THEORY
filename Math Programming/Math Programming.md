Mathematical programming is a branch of higher mathematics devoted to solving problems related to finding the extrema of functions of several variables, in the presence of restrictions on the variables.

**Mathematical programming methods** are used to solve problems of resource allocation, production planning, pricing, transport problems, etc.

**The construction** of a mathematical model of an economic problem includes the following steps:
Selecting Task Variables
Drafting system constraints
Choice of objective function

**The variables** of the task are the values x1, x2, x3, ..., xn, which completely characterize the economic process.
They are usually written as a vector X=(x1, x2, x3, â€¦, xn)

**The system of constraints** includes a system of equations and inequalities that are satisfied by the task variables and that follow from the limited resources or other economic or physical conditions, for example, the positivity of the variables, etc.

**The target function** is a function of task variables that characterizes the quality of the task, and the extremum of which is required to be found.

Task classification:
- By the nature of the relationship between variables: (Linear or Nonlinear)
- By the nature of the change in variables: (Continuous or Discrete)
- The time factor: (Static, dynamic)
- By the availability of information about variables: (conditions of complete certainty, conditions of incomplete information, under conditions of uncertainty)
- According to the number of criteria for evaluating alternatives: (Simple single-criteria tasks, Complex multicriteria tasks)

Linear programming problem: find the minimum or maximum of the objective function under constraints.
