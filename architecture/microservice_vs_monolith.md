[[microservices]] and [[monolith]] are two approaches to designing software systems. Microservices are a software architecture in which a large application is divided into small, independent components that communicate with each other through APIs. Each microservice is designed to perform a specific function and can be developed, tested, and deployed independently. Monoliths, on the other hand, are a traditional software architecture in which an application is built as a single, large codebase. Monoliths are typically deployed as a single unit and are more difficult to scale and modify than microservices
Here are some pros and cons of microservices and monoliths:
Pros of microservices: 
	● Scalability: Microservices can be scaled independently, which allows you to scale only the components that need it. 
	● Flexibility: Microservices are modular and can be developed, tested, and deployed independently, which makes them easier to modify and maintain. 
	● Resilience: If one microservice fails, the others can still function, which increases the overall resilience of the system.
Cons of microservices: 
	● Complexity: Microservices can be more complex to develop and maintain, as they require more infrastructure and coordination. 
	● Performance: Microservices can potentially be slower than monoliths due to the overhead of inter-service communication.
Pros of monoliths: 
	● Simplicity: Monoliths are simpler to develop and maintain, as they consist of a single codebase.
	● Performance: Monoliths can potentially be faster than microservices due to their simplicity and the lack of overhead for inter-service communication. 
Cons of monoliths: 
	● Scalability: Monoliths are more difficult to scale, as they must be deployed and scaled as a single unit. 
	● Flexibility: Monoliths are more difficult to modify and maintain, as changes to the codebase can affect the entire system.
