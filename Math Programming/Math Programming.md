Mathematical programming is a branch of higher mathematics devoted to solving problems related to finding the extrema of functions of several variables, in the presence of restrictions on the variables.

Mathematical programming methods are used to solve problems of resource allocation, production planning, pricing, transport problems, etc.

The construction of a mathematical model of an economic problem includes the following steps:
Selecting Task Variables
Drafting system constraints
Choice of objective function
