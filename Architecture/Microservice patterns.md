1. **Service Decomposition**: Identify the boundaries and responsibilities of each service, breaking down the monolithic application into smaller services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

2. **API Gateway**: Use an API Gateway to act as the entry point for clients to interact with the microservices. It handles client requests, performs authentication, and routes requests to the appropriate microservices.

3. **Service Registry and Discovery**: Implement a service registry where services can register themselves and a service discovery mechanism that allows services to find and communicate with each other dynamically.

4. **Database per Service**: Each microservice should have its database, ensuring that each service can manage its data independently. This helps to avoid tight coupling between services through a shared database.

5. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use asynchronous communication through events to decouple services and enable them to react to changes and updates in other services without direct dependencies.

6. **Circuit Breaker**: Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures when a service is not responding. It helps to fail fast and provides fallback mechanisms when a service is unavailable.

7. **Centralized Configuration**: Use a centralized configuration management system to manage the configuration of microservices, allowing for dynamic updates without requiring service restarts.
    
8. **Distributed Tracing**: Implement distributed tracing to monitor and troubleshoot the flow of requests across microservices, gaining insights into the performance and behavior of the entire system.

9. **Bulkhead**: Isolate critical services from non-critical services, ensuring that failures in one part of the system do not bring down the entire application.

10. **Polyglot Persistence**: Choose the most suitable database technology for each microservice, depending on its specific requirements, instead of a one-size-fits-all approach.

11. **Saga Pattern**: Implement the saga pattern to manage distributed transactions across multiple services, ensuring consistency in the system.
    
12. **Versioning**: Implement versioning in APIs to manage backward compatibility as microservices evolve and change over time.

13. **Containerization and Orchestration**: Use containerization technologies like Docker and container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes to simplify deployment and scaling of microservices.
