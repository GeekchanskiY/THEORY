### Linked List
Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, resulting in easily calculable addresses for the elements stored and this allows faster access to an element at a specific index. Linked lists are less rigid in their storage structure and elements are usually not stored in contiguous locations, hence they need to be stored with additional tags giving a reference to the next element. This difference in the data storage scheme decides which data structure would be more suitable for a given situation.

- A linked list is a linear data structure that stores a collection of data elements dynamically.

- Nodes represent those data elements, and links or pointers connect each node.

- Each node consists of two fields, the information stored in a linked list and a pointer that stores the address of its next node.

- The last node contains null in its second field because it will point to no node.

- A linked list can grow and shrink its size, as per the requirement.

- It does not waste memory space.



### Stack
First-in last-out data structure
**Stack** is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be **LIFO(Last In First Out)** or **FILO(First In Last Out)**. LIFO implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first and **FILO** implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.
