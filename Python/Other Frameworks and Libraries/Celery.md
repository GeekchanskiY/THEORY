Celery is a task queue and distributed task scheduler written in Python. It is used to schedule and execute tasks asynchronously, allowing you to perform long-running tasks in the background while your main application continues to run. To use Celery, you first define one or more tasks, which are units of work that you want to be performed asynchronously. Tasks can be defined as Python functions or methods, and they can take arguments and return results. You can then use Celery to execute these tasks at a later time, either by scheduling them to run at a specific time or by adding them to a queue to be processed as soon as possible. Celery supports a variety of message brokers, including RabbitMQ and Redis, which it uses to transmit task messages between the client and the workers that execute the tasks. It also includes features for retrying tasks that fail, handling task dependencies, and monitoring task progress. Celery is often used in web applications to perform tasks such as sending emails, processing images, or handling data imports, but it can be used in any application that needs to perform asynchronous tasks.
Here are a few best practices for using Celery: 
1. Use a message broker: Celery relies on a message broker to transmit task messages between the client and workers. Choose a message broker that is reliable, scalable, and well-suited to your needs. 
2. Use a task queue: A task queue stores the tasks that are waiting to be executed, allowing the workers to retrieve and process them as soon as possible. Choose a task queue that is fast, durable, and able to handle the volume of tasks you expect to receive. 
3. Use multiple workers: To scale your task processing, you can use multiple workers to execute tasks in parallel. You can also use worker pools to assign tasks to different groups of workers based on task type or priority. 
4. Use task routing: Use task routing to send tasks to specific workers or worker pools based on the task type or other criteria. This can help you better distribute the workload among your workers and optimize their performance. 
5. Monitor your tasks: Use Celery's monitoring and reporting features to track the progress and status of your tasks, and to identify and troubleshoot any issues that may arise. 
6. Use task retries: If tasks fail due to temporary issues, you can use Celery's task retry feature to automatically retry failed tasks a certain number of times before giving up. This can help you improve the reliability and robustness of your tasks. 
7. Use task dependencies: Use task dependencies to specify the order in which tasks should be executed, or to ensure that certain tasks are only executed after other tasks have completed successfully. 
By following these best practices, you can effectively and efficiently use Celery to manage and execute your asynchronous tasks.

Priorities in celery
In Celery, you can use task priorities to specify the relative importance or urgency of tasks. Tasks with higher priorities will be processed before tasks with lower priorities, allowing you to prioritize certain tasks over others. To set the priority of a task in Celery, you can use the priority argument when applying the task decorator. For example:

---
from celery import task

@task(priority=10)
def high_priority_task():
	pass

---

You can also use the apply_async method to specify the priority of a task when you execute it.
Keep in mind that task priorities are relative to each other, and they only affect the order in which tasks are executed within a single task queue. Tasks in different queues are not compared by priority. Using task priorities can be a useful way to prioritize certain tasks over others and ensure that they are executed in a timely manner. However, be careful not to rely too heavily on task priorities, as they can make your task processing less predictable and harder to debug.

## Types of tasks in Celery
In Celery, there are two types of tasks: regular tasks and periodic tasks. Regular tasks are tasks that are executed once, either immediately or at a specific time in the future. They are defined using the @task decorator, and they can be executed using the apply_async method or by adding them to a task queue. Periodic tasks are tasks that are scheduled to run at regular intervals, such as every hour or every day. They are defined using the @periodic_task decorator, and they are executed by the Celery Beat scheduling service.
