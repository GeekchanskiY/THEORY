Delivery Guarantees:
RabbitMQ provides at least once delivery guarantees by default, but also offers support for at most once delivery and exactly once delivery through the use of publisher confirms and transactions. RabbitMQ also provides configurable message persistence and durability, allowing developers to specify whether messages should be persisted to disk and how long to retain them before they are deleted.
