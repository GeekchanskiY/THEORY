Variables are the backbone of any program, and thus the backbone of any computer programming language. I like to start off by defining what we're about to learn, so, Wikipedia defines a variable as follows:
```wikipedia
In computer programming, a variable is a storage location and an associated symbolic name which contains some known or unknown quantity or information, a value.
```
In most of modern courses, variable is being explained as a container, which stores a value. In most of programming language variable also has some or all of these parameters:
Scope of visibility, which defines where you can or can not use it.
Mutability, which means your ability to change it during the runtime.
Data type, which describes the value inside, and what are you able to do with it's contents.
and others
Variables may be as a single integer, class instance, reference(link) to another variable, or they may store nothing as an option. Each programming language implements variable on it's own.
