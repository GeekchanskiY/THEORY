That's the  GREAT RoadMap with all the theory(and a bit practice also) that I'm not lazy to write here.
I'm not sure that the road will be not chaotic because of my current level of knowledge, but the goal is to hold all the info in one place to be able to repeat any time. 

## Main Topics of this Roadmap:

**1. [[Network applications]]**
**2. [[Architecture Patterns]]**
**3. [[DataBases]]**
**4. [[Design Patterns]]**
**5. [[Development methodology]]**
**6. [[Python]]**
**7. [[Programming Basics]]**
**8. [[Cloud Computing Services]]**
**9. [[Message Brokers]]**
**10. [[Math Programming]]**
