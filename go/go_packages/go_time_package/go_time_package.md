Package time provides functionality for measuring and displaying time.

The calendrical calculations always assume a Gregorian calendar, with no leap seconds.
### Default behavior
By default, if you have `time.Time` in your struct which you wish to unmarshal from json, it supports `RFC 3339` format.
