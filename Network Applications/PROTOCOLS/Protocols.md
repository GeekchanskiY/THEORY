TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

## Useful tips
"Service", "process" and "server" are information technology terms often used to describe various components and aspects of computer systems. Here are their definitions:

1. **Service:**
    - In the context of computer systems, a service is a program or application that runs in the background and provides certain functions or resources to other programs or devices on the network.
    - Services can be either system (for example, memory management service or network service) or user-defined (for example, anti-virus scanning services or database services).
    - Example: Windows Update updates the Windows operating system with new fixes and improvements.

2. **Process:**
    - A process is an instance of a running program on a computer. Each file launched by a program (for example, an application or service) creates its own process in the operating system.
    - A process includes executable code, data, call stack, and resources needed to execute the program.
    - Multitasking systems can have many processes running in parallel.
    - Example: If you have a web browser, a text editor and an antivirus application open, then each of them has its own process in the operating system.

3. **Server:**
    - A server is a dedicated computer or program that provides certain services or resources to other computers, called clients, on a network.
    - Servers can provide a variety of services, such as storing files (file server), processing web requests (web server), email (mail server), etc.
    - Servers usually operate continuously and provide clients with access to their services during the entire operation time.
    - Example: Gmail or Yahoo Mail are mail servers that process and store user emails and provide access to them through a web interface.

Together, these terms describe various aspects of the functioning and interaction of computer systems in modern information technologies.
