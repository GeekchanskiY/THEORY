## REpresentational State Transfer

REST, or REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other. REST-compliant systems, often called RESTful systems, are characterized by how they are stateless and separate the concerns of client and server. We will go into what these terms mean and why they are beneficial characteristics for services on the Web. Pay close attention: If youâ€™re looking for a career in tech, you may be asked to define rest during an interview.


### Principles:
	- Separation of client and server
	- Statelessness
	- Uniform interface
