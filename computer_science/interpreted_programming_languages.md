Interpreted programming languages are languages which use interpreting for translation to machine code, which means they execute it line by line, which is slower than compiling, but allows you to change some values in the runtime significantly easier than in the compiling languages, but in general runtime is slower. 

Speed of interpreted languages is being fixed using JIT (Just-in-time compilation), which is a compilation design that implies that compilation happens on demand when the code is run the first time. Itâ€™s a very broad term that could mean many things, and also has different types.

Examples of interpreted programming languages are python and javascript
