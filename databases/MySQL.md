[[SQL]]

MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It is used to store and manage data in a structured way, using tables and relationships between those tables. One of the key features of MySQL is its support for SQL, which is a standardized language for managing and querying data in a relational database. This allows you to use SQL statements to create, modify, and query data in your database. MySQL is widely used in web applications, and is often used in combination with a server-side language like PHP to build dynamic websites. It is also used in a variety of other applications, including data warehousing, e-commerce, and logging applications. If you are new to MySQL, you might want to start by reading the official documentation, which provides a comprehensive guide to using the database. There are also many resources available online that can help you learn more about MySQL and how to use it effectively.
