**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is a widespread terminology among [DevOps](https://k21academy.com/devops-foundation/overview-devops-devops-principles-advantages-of-devops-why-devops/) professionals and a key DevOps practice in the industry. It is the process of managing and provisioning the complete IT infrastructure (comprises both physical and virtual machines) using machine-readable definition files. It helps in automating the complete data center by using programming scripts.

#### **Popular IaC Tools:**

**1. Terraform** An open-source declarative tool that offers pre-written modules to build and manage an infrastructure.  
**2. Chef:** A configuration management tool that uses cookbooks and recipes to deploy the desired environment. Best used for Deploying and configuring applications using a pull-based approach.  
**3. Puppet:** Popular tool for configuration management that follows a Client-Server Model. Puppet needs agents to be deployed on the target machines before the puppet can start managing them.  
**4. Ansible:** Ansible is used for building infrastructure as well as deploying and configuring applications on top of them. Best used for Ad hoc analysis.  
**5. Packer:** Unique tool that generates VM images (not running VMs) based on steps you provide. Best used for Baking compute images.  
**6. Vagrant:** Builds VMs using a workflow. Best used for Creating pre-configured developer VMs within VirtualBox.
