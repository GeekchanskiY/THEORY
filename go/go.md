Go is an open source programming language that makes it simple to build secure, scalable systems. Designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and  Ken Thompson in 2007, publicly announced at 2009. Firstly was motivated by shared dislike of C++. Version 1.0 was released in march 2012. Original and preferred name is `Go`, but due to domain `golang.org` may also be called `Golang`. First go compiler was written in C, but was rewritten in Go itself (and a little bit assembler) after version [1.5](https://go.dev/doc/go1.5) using bootstrapping.

 Key features:
  - Simplicity and readability
  - Fast compilation
  - Built-in concurrency
  - Strong standard library
  - Cross-platform
  - Garbage collection
  - Structural typing
  - Tooling support
  - Easy to learn*

What's possible for go:
- Command-line interfaces (CLI)
- Cloud and network services
- Web development
- Development Operations & Site Reliability Engineering (DevOPS)
