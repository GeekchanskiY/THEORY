Repository to store all theory in a one place, which was built to use with obsidian.

Earlier I tried to use some plugins like execute_code, auto-backup, etc. But when I  used a lot them, it became significantly harder to read the document, so now I want to make it look like a default book with some illustrations and listings. 

Start with [[Hard Skills]]

And remember: `THEORY must grow`
