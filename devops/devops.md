**DevOps** is the integration and automation of the software development and information technology operations. DevOps encompasses necessary tasks of software development and can lead to shortening development time and improving the development life cycle. According to Neal Ford, DevOps, particularly through continuous delivery, employs the "Bring the pain forward" principle, tackling tough tasks early, fostering automation and swift issue detection. Software programmers and architects should use fitness functions to keep their software in check.

Although debated, DevOps is characterized by key principles: shared ownership, workflow automation, and rapid feedback. From an academic perspective, Len Bass, Ingo Weber, and Liming Zhu—three computer science researchers from the CSIRO and the Software Engineering Institute—suggested defining DevOps as "a set of practices intended to reduce the time between committing a change to a system and the change being placed into normal production, while ensuring high quality". However, the term is used in multiple contexts. At its most successful, DevOps is a combination of specific practices, culture change, and tools.

## Relevant metrics
DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) has developed a series of metrics which are intended to measure software development efficiency and reliability. These metrics include: 
- Deployment Frequency: Time between code deployments.
- Mean Lead Time for Changes: Time between code commit and deployment.
- Change Failure Rate: Percentage of deployments causing production issues.
- Failed Deployment Recovery Time (formerly Mean Time To Recover)
- Reliability (added in 2021): Measures operational performance, focusing on availability and adherence to user expectations.
