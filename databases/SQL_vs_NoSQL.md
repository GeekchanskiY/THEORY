[[SQL]] (Structured Query Language) and [[NoSQL]] (Not Only SQL) are two different types of databases. SQL databases are based on the relational model and use a structured query language (SQL) for storing, manipulating, and querying data. They are well-suited for handling structured data (such as data in tables) and support transactions (which allow multiple queries to be executed as a single unit). Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data (such as data in documents or key-value pairs) and do not use SQL as their primary query language. They are often more scalable and flexible than SQL databases, but they do not support transactions in the same way. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis. There are pros and cons to both types of databases, and the best choice for a particular project will depend on the specific needs and requirements of the project. SQL databases are generally more powerful and feature-rich, but they can be more complex to set up and manage. NoSQL databases are generally simpler and more flexible, but they may not offer the same level of functionality and performance as SQL databases.
