[[NoSQL]]

The open-source, in-memory data store used by millions of developers as a cache, vector database, document database, streaming engine, and message broker.

## Core capabilities
### In-memory data structures
Well-known as a "data structure server", with support for strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, streams, and more.

### Programmability
Server-side scripting with Lua and server-side stored procedures with Redis Functions.

### Persistence
Keeps the dataset in memory for fast access, but can also persist all writes to permanent storage to survive reboots and system failures.

### Extensibility
A module API for building custom extensions to Redis in C, C++, and Rust.

### Clustering
Horizontal scalability with hash-based sharding, scaling to millions of nodes with automatic re-partitioning when growing the cluster.

### High availability
Replication with automatic failover for both standalone and clustered deployments.
