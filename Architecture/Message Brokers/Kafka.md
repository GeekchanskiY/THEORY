Architecture:
Kafka is based on a publish-subscribe model, where producers send messages to topics, and consumers subscribe to one or more topics and receive messages from them

Scalability:
Kafka is designed to handle large volumes of data and is horizontally scalable, meaning it can handle increased load by adding more brokers to the cluster

Durability:
Kafka support message durability, meaning messages are persisted to disk and can survive server restarts. However, Kafka provides more options for configuring message durability, including the ability to specify how long to retain messages and how many copies of each message to keep.

Stream processing:
Kafka includes built-in support for stream processing, allowing developers to build real-time data pipelines and applications that process and analyze data as it is produced.

Kafka can be integrated with a variety of stream processing and data processing frameworks, and is often used in conjunction with tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Flink, and Apache Hadoop.

Delivery guarantees:
Kafka provides several delivery guarantees, including at least once delivery, at most once delivery, and exactly once delivery. The specific guarantee provided depends on the configuration of the Kafka producer and consumer, as well as the configuration of the Kafka cluster. Kafka also provides configurable retention periods for messages, allowing developers to specify how long to retain messages on the server before they are deleted.
