**Packet** (or datagram) is a segment of data sent from one computer or device to another over a network. The term was first coined by Donald Davis in 1965. The packet contains the source, destination, size, type, and other useful information that helps get the packet to its destination and read it. An example of a TCP packet breakdown is shown below.

The speed at which packets are transmitted is shown by [ping](http://linchakin.com/%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%8C/% D0%BF/%D0%BF%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B3), it is measured in milliseconds.

## Some information about packages

- Another name for a package is **datagram**.
- Data transmitted over the Internet is transmitted in the form of one or more packets. The most common packet is TCP.
- Packet size is limited, so most data sent over the network is split into several packets before being sent, and then they are combined when received.
- When a packet travels across a network, network routers and switches examine the packet and its source to help send it in the right direction.
- The packet may be lost during transmission. If the data packet is not received or an error occurs, it is sent again.
