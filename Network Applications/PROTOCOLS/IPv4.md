IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol, which was one of the first versions and is still widely used on networks around the world. Here are the main characteristics of IPv4:

1. **32-bit addresses:** IPv4 uses 32-bit (four-byte) addresses, which limits the number of unique IP addresses available to approximately 4.3 billion.

2. **Decimal Notation:** IPv4 addresses are represented in decimal notation, consisting of four numbers separated by dots, for example, 192.168.0.1.

3. **Hierarchical structure:** IPv4 addresses have a hierarchical structure, including the network part and the device (host) within that network. The network part identifies the network, and the host part identifies a specific device on that network.

4. **Classful Addressing:** In IPv4, there are classes of addresses: A, B, C, D, and E. The classes determine which part of the address is used for the network and the host. However, classful addressing has become obsolete and has been replaced by the more flexible CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) addressing.

5. **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):** CIDR provides a more flexible way to allocate IP addresses by allowing the use of variable prefix lengths, which allows for more efficient use of address space.

6. **Naturally Exhaustible Resource:** Due to the limited number of available IPv4 addresses, the networking community is moving to IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) to accommodate increased address space.

7. **Supports different types of services:** IPv4 supports various services, such as data transmission, voice and video communications, multimedia streams and other types of data.

8. **Support for upper layer protocols:** IPv4 is the basis for upper layer protocols such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol), which provide reliable and unreliable data delivery respectively.

9. **Routing:** IPv4 addressing supports routing, allowing data to pass through multiple networks and routers to reach its final destination.

10. **Internet Proliferation:** IPv4 has long been the primary protocol for routing data packets on the Internet. However, the exhaustion of addresses and the transition to IPv6 led to a decrease in its importance.

Although IPv4 continues to be used, given address exhaustion, IPv6 was developed, which provides significantly larger address space and other improvements. Over time, IPv6 has become an increasingly common and important protocol for networks.
