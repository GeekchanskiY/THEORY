**Searching** is the fundamental process of locating a specific element or item within a collection of data. This collection of data can take various forms, such as arrays, lists, trees, or other structured representations.

## Characteristics of Searching

Understanding the characteristics of searching in data structures and algorithms is crucial for designing efficient algorithms and making informed decisions about which searching technique to employ. Here, we explore key aspects and characteristics associated with searching:
1. Target Element: in searching, there is always a specific target element or item that you want to find within the data collection. This target could be a value, a record, a key, or any other data entity of interest.
2. Search Space: the search space refers to the entire collection of data within which you are looking for the target element. Depending on the data structure used, the search space may vary in size and organization.
 3. Complexity: searching can have different levels of complexity depending on the data structure and the algorithm used. The complexity is often measured in terms of time and space requirements.
 4. Deterministic vs Non-deterministic: some searching algorithms, like *binary search*, are deterministic, meaning they follow a clear and systematic approach. Others, such as linear search, are non-deterministic, as they may need to examine the entire search space in the worst case.
