Repository to store all theory in a one place.

Now, it's also used as a database, so that's why I prefer to do a default format for each document to be able to parse them later.

<div style="padding: 20px; display: flex; justify-content: center; width: 100%;"><a href="https://github.com/GeekchanskiY"><div style="width: 120; height: 50; background-color: #3b3b3b;  display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; border-radius: 15px; padding: 10px;">my github</div></a><a href="https://t.me/GeekanskiY"><div style="width: 120; height: 50; background-color: #3b3b3b; margin-left: 30px;  display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; border-radius: 15px; padding: 10px;">my telegram</div></a></div>
### Repository structure
Image it's a roadmap for teaching a newbie, each folder level is diving deeper and deeper into the specific documentation. The most nested folder usually should be a package, or a sub-package, where each document describes how it works, contains some features, snippets, hints, etc. In future snippets probably will be stored in a separate repository.
### Obsidian settings
Earlier I tried to use some plugins like execute_code, auto-backup, etc. But when I  used a lot them, it became literally impossible to read the document, so now I want to make it look like a default book with some illustrations and listings as a maximum of customization. Maybe using some default obsidian features, like rendering html, and so on, just to prettify. 
### How to expand THEORY database
! Important: notes are being refactored to a new structure.
Usually each topic is a sub-topic of another. For me, if there's a sub-topic which was not described as a standalone theme, it's better to remove an article to a separate document, and leave a link here and in a `Links` block, to avoid being lost.
And remember: `Theory must grow`.
