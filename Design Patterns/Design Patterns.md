Contains 3 types:
	1 - [[Creational patterns]]
		They used to create new instances, which can be previously specified, or just an abstract objects. Abstract the process of instantiation. They make it possible to make the system independent of the method of creating, composing and presenting objects. The template that generates classes uses inheritance to modify the class being instantiated, while the template that generates objects delegates the instantiation to another object.
	2 - [[Structural Patterns]]
		They used to create relations between objects, define various complex structures that change the interface of existing objects or its implementation, making it easier to develop and optimize the program.
	3 - [[Behavioral patterns]]
		They used to define the interaction between objects, increasing the flexibility
