### Team roles:
**Project managers (PM's)** - A project manager is a professional in the field of project management. Project managers have the responsibility of the planning, procurement and execution of a project, in any undertaking that has a defined scope, defined start and a defined finish; regardless of industry.

**Business analyst** - The _business analyst_ defines a _business's_ needs and recommends solutions to make the organization better.

**Project leader** - is a project management expert that leads project teams through the project life cycle like a project manager would, only that the two roles mainly differ in that a project leader is people-oriented while the project manager is results-oriented. This means that while many of their responsibilities overlap, the project leader is more focused on motivating teams by using leadership techniques such as servant leadership.


### Types of project team structure

**Project-based team structure** - This is the most traditional project team structure that’s used in most projects. In this type of project team, the project manager is given the most authority over team members and they all report to him or her. This individual is also in charge of creating a project plan and schedule, assembling a team, assigning tasks and responsibilities and overseeing the project every step of the way. For this reason, we characterize this type of structure as “projectized” because the structure of the team is driven by the demands of the individual project.

**Functional project team structure** - In a functional project team structure, there are multiple functional managers that oversee their teams instead of just one project manager. As the name suggests, those teams accomplish specific functions for an organization, such as marketing, sales or product development. Below each leader, the next tier is made up of a group of team members. For example, the tier below a marketing leader might be made of a content writer, an editor, an email manager, etc. These team members report to their respective leaders, and the leaders report to the project manager at the top. Having such a structure is important for team management.

**Matrix-Based Project Team Structure** - Assembling a project team is just as much about selecting team members as it is about fleshing out the project’s organizational structure. Regardless of the organizational structure you choose, this entails setting up rules and procedures, defining expectations and establishing communication. If these things aren’t clearly defined before the project begins, they’ll inevitably lead to trouble down the road.
