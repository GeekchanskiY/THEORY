SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured messages in distributed computing environments, based on XML (eXtensible Markup Language). SOAP is used to exchange data between software components running on different platforms and in different programming languages over the network, most often using HTTP or SMTP. Here are the main characteristics and functions of SOAP:

1. **Simplicity and Extensibility:** SOAP was designed to be a simple and easy to read XML based protocol. This makes it accessible and understandable to developers, and its structured format makes it easy to add and expand new data elements.

2. **Platform and Language Independence:** SOAP allows different software components, written in different languages and running on different platforms, to communicate and call methods on remote objects over the network. This makes SOAP ideal for creating distributed applications.

3. **Transparency and Security:** SOAP supports various authentication and data encryption methods, making it secure for transmitting confidential or sensitive data over the network.

4. **Interoperability:** The SOAP protocol is standardized, which means that different implementations of SOAP on different platforms must support common standards, which ensures high interoperability between different systems.

5. **Remote Procedure Call (RPC):** SOAP supports remote procedure calls, which allows applications to call methods and functions on remote servers as if they were local.

6. **Proxies and Handlers:** SOAP can use proxies and handlers to process messages before and after they are sent, giving additional flexibility in data management.

7. **Basis for Web Services:** SOAP is one of the protocols used to create web services that provide functionality and data over the Internet using standardized protocols and data formats.

SOAP is widely used in distributed systems, web services, application integration, and other scenarios where data exchange between remote software components is required.
