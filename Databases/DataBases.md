CAP theorem
In theoretical computer science, the **CAP theorem**, also named **Brewer's theorem** after computer scientist Eric Brewer, states that any distributed data store can provide only two of the following three guarantees:

- Consistency
 Every read receives the most recent write or an error.

- Availability
 Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write.

- Partition tolerance
 The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes.
