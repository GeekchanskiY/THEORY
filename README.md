Repository to store all theory in a one place, which was built to use with obsidian. 

<div style="padding: 20px; display: flex; justify-content: center; width: 100%;"><a href="https://github.com/GeekchanskiY"><div style="width: 120; height: 50; background-color: #3b3b3b;  display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; border-radius: 15px; padding: 10px;">my github</div></a><a href="https://t.me/GeekanskiY"><div style="width: 120; height: 50; background-color: #3b3b3b; margin-left: 30px;  display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; border-radius: 15px; padding: 10px;">my telegram</div></a></div>

### Obsidian settings
Earlier I tried to use some plugins like execute_code, auto-backup, etc. But when I  used a lot them, it became significantly harder to read the document, so now I want to make it look like a default book with some illustrations and listings. 

Start with [[Hard Skills]]

And remember: `THEORY must grow`
