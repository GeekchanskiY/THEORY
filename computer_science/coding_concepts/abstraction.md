In computer science, abstraction is a process of generalizing concrete details. Actually, it's one of the object-oriented programming concepts. You can use it to have separate usage and representation of data. It's much easier to explain talking about interfaces. For example, you have a function which takes an 'animal' interface, and calls it's method run inside. So you can use each animal, which will run inside this function, and you will not have to rewrite this function for handling different types. The same way abstraction works with inheritance.
