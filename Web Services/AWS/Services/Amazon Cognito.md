## User pools vs Identity Pools
### **User Pools**:
- User pools are user directories that provide sign-up and sign-in options for your application users.
- They are used to manage user accounts and authentication for your application.
- User pools support standard authentication mechanisms like username/password, social identity providers (e.g., Google, Facebook), and SAML-based identity providers.
- You can customize the sign-up and sign-in flows, enable multi-factor authentication (MFA), and implement password recovery mechanisms.
- User pools also offer features like email/phone verification, user profile attributes, and user groups.
- User pools are primarily used for applications that have their own user management system and require user authentication.

### **Identity Pools**:

- Identity pools, also known as Federated Identities, enable you to grant temporary, limited access to your AWS resources to users authenticated by external identity providers (like Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0 identity provider).
- They act as an intermediary between the identity providers and your AWS resources, allowing you to use third-party identity information to grant access to AWS services.
- Identity pools provide AWS credentials to your application users, allowing them to access authorized resources securely.
- With identity pools, you can grant access to AWS resources based on the identity information obtained from external providers, and you can also map the external identity information to IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles that define what actions users can perform within AWS.
- Identity pools are commonly used in applications that want to grant access to AWS resources based on external identities without having to manage separate user accounts for each identity.
